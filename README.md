# Gaussian Processes from Scratch

## Why this repository exists
- To demonstrate a first-principles understanding of Gaussian Process models
- To make modeling assumptions and computational trade-offs explicit
- To go beyond library-level usage and expose inference and prediction mechanics
- To support work on nonstationary and structured time series

## What is in this repository
- Core Gaussian Process formulations implemented from scratch
- Covariance function design and composition
- Likelihood evaluation and scalable inference methods
- Prediction with uncertainty quantification
- Numerical considerations relevant to real-world data

This repository is intended for quantitative researchers and research scientists working with probabilistic models.
